Passage: This past weekend , my family made so much food that there was still plenty of it going into the week . Knowing this , we chose not to make any new food , because we could still eat the leftover food from the weekend . All we would need to do was warm it up on the stove top . The stove is a gas stove , which produces a flame that , in my opinion , cooks food much better than an electric stove . On Monday after getting home from work , rather than making a new meal , my mom took some of the food that we had saved from the weekend and put it into a pan , and put that pan on the stove . She turned the gas on until the burner ignited , and left the heat on until she felt that the food was warm enough . When she ate it , she swore it was as good as it was when it was freshly made .
Question: Where were they heating the food ?
 On an electric stove .  0.944746

Passage: Today was the start of Spring , so I decided it was time to get some cleaning done . The first and largest thing to deal with was my apartment flat . I started by picking up any loose items that were not in their proper place . I put as many items into drawers and closets as possible to reduce clutter . I then moved all the furniture so I could clean the floors where the furniture is normally sitting . I vacuumed the exposed floor then moved the furniture back into place with a couple changes in the arrangement for fun . Then I swept the rest of the floor after dusting any surfaces that needed it . Afterwards , I cleaned all the windows , inside and out , and moved to the bathroom . After wiping down all the surfaces in the bathroom with a disinfecting cleaner , I took a look around my flat to assess my work . My apartment was now clean and it felt great !

Passage: I had been wanting to get my tattoo fixed for five years now and I just could n't seem to save up the several hundred dollars it would cost to get it fixed . The other day it dawned on mt that I could buy my own tattoo machine online . I researched tattoo machines , needles and inks for the better part of a month at different online retailers before I decided on a retailer . I then researched the product and how to use it for a few more weeks . I watched videos about the product , tutorials and user reviews . I figured since I am an artist and pretty good at drawing and tracing that I would give it a go . I saved up amazon gift cards for several more weeks . It took a while but I eventually saved the better part of a hundred dollars , one dollar gift card at a time . I decided to finally make my purchase and the product arrived two days later .

Passage: This morning I woke up and all the covers were off my bed . Even though I do n't normally make up my bed , this morning it was necessary . I decided to change my sheets , since they were off anyway . First , I removed all the sheets and comforter . I placed the comforter on the side . I gathered up the sheets and pillow cases and brought them to the laundry . Next , I got out another set of clean sheets . I unfolded the fitted sheet , that has elastic around the edges . I stretched the sheet over each corner , making a nice tight area . Next , I put the flat sheet on , tucking in the bottom and the sides . Next , I replaced the comforter , being sure that all the sides were hanging over the same amount . I put clean pillow cases on the pillows and put them at the head of my bed .

Passage: One time in a restaurant I had to send the food back . Let me tell you what happened . Well , it was over one week ago , last Tuesday .

Passage: This weekend , I decided I wanted to try baking my first cake . I found a recipe online for an easy to make cake , printed out a list of the ingredients , and went to the grocery store to get them . I knew about some of the common things , like eggs , flour , and sugar , but the list helped me get a lot of things I did n't own and would n't know to get . When I got home , I followed the recipe as closely as I could , adding each of the ingredients at the exact amount of the recipe asked for . I mixed them all up as described , and put them into a pan that I had borrowed from my mother . I put the pan in the oven and let the cake cook . I checked on it occasionally to see if it was looking OK , and because I was really excited to see how it was turning out . When it was done in the oven I removed it , and applied an extra thick coat of frosting . I was supposed to wait for the cake to cook , but I was too excited to try it out and ate it much sooner than recommended . It was delicious !

Passage: I knew he was sick because he told me so . It did n't help that he was coughing and sneezing . He had n't been able to get out of bed for days . It looked like he had a fever . He had gone to the doctor a few days ago . He had a prescription from them , but he was n't able to take the medicine himself . He needed it . I went to the cupboard we kept it in and took out the medicine . It was in a small bottle . The medicine was liquid , so it was easy to administer . I opened the bottle . Then I measured out a single dose into its cap . I set the cap of medicine down on the counter before grabbing a small glass of water . With both the medicine and the water in my hand , I went back to his room . He opened his mouth for me . I pressed the cap to his mouth , making sure he drank all of it . Then he had some water .

Passage: Keeping a clean bathroom to me is an important part of good hygiene . This is something that I had to do just recently . I noticed that the toilet and counters were stained , and that the mirrors were filthy . I then set aside all of the necessary cleaners to use in the bathroom , and got to work . I first worked on the counter tops . I used a special marble cleaner to clean them , and it really made them shine . After the counters , I did the mirrors . I used a very strong glass cleaner to get the job done , and by the time I finished , the mirrors were spotless . Lastly , I took care of the toilet . I cleaned the outside of it with the same marble cleaner I used on the counters , and used a special toilet bowl cleaner for the inside of the bowl . Just for good measure , I mopped the floor of the bathroom , washed out the bathtub with shower cleaner , and sprayed the room with air freshener to make it smell nice .

Passage: Keeping a clean bathroom to me is an important part of good hygiene . This is something that I had to do just recently . I noticed that the toilet and counters were stained , and that the mirrors were filthy . I then set aside all of the necessary cleaners to use in the bathroom , and got to work . I first worked on the counter tops . I used a special marble cleaner to clean them , and it really made them shine . After the counters , I did the mirrors . I used a very strong glass cleaner to get the job done , and by the time I finished , the mirrors were spotless . Lastly , I took care of the toilet . I cleaned the outside of it with the same marble cleaner I used on the counters , and used a special toilet bowl cleaner for the inside of the bowl . Just for good measure , I mopped the floor of the bathroom , washed out the bathtub with shower cleaner , and sprayed the room with air freshener to make it smell nice .
Question: What did they use to clean the toilet ?
 Shower cleaner  0.562648

Passage: I miss my best friend Shelly and so I decided to send her a letter telling her all about my trip to my sister ’s house in Alaska , and to also tell her that I hoped she was well . I finished writing my letter and as I went to find a stamp and an envelope I needed to send it , I had found that I did not have any . I went to a store that sells cards and envelopes , and chose a box of pretty purple - colored envelopes to mail my letter in . After that I went to the post office to purchase some stamps that are like small stickers , and chose a heart design that I liked . I only needed one to send the letter but I bought more so that I could send another letter soon if I wanted to . When I got home I filled out the envelope with Shelly ’s name and address in the middle , and wrote my sister ’s address in the top left corner of the envelope .

Passage: My dad is a great cook and one of the things he knows how to cook good is fish . Sometimes he buys the fish from the supermarket and sometimes he buys the fish from the fish market . When he buys it from the supermarket he buys it by the pound and it is usually already cut up into pieces and cleaned up . When he buys it from the fish market he has to clean it out more and take out the bones . Some of the fish he buys still has the head , fins and tail so he has to cut those parts out too . The head of the fish is really good to make fish soup . I like it better when he leaves the scales ( skin ) of the fish as it tastes really good . There are many different ways that he cooks the fish . Sometimes he will fry it in a pan or deep fry the fish and also put some bread crumbs on the fish before frying it . He also bakes the fish in the oven which makes it soft and tender . My favorite is when dad steams the fish a little bit and we eat it semi - raw like sushi . In the summer time dad will also throw some fish on the grill and barbeque it . My mom told me that eating fish is really good for you as it has a lot of essentials vitamins and oils and eating fish makes you live longer and is also god for your brain .

The world was new in a sense , and I can vividly see myself the morning I first awoke in my new home . I went to making scrambled eggs , and these eggs were not any ordinary eggs . They were the most amazing eggs that I have ever had the pleasure of eating . It was not just the combination of being in a new place and starting new that made the eggs better . It was as if in that moment in my life , everything synced together so perfectly , that these scrambled eggs I made were just the cherry on top of my life 's Sunday .
Question: how many people were involved in cooking ?
*One  0.512759

Passage: Today was my birthday and I received a card from my friend who lives in India . I wanted to reply to her card and thank her for remembering me on my birthday . As I started writing I started to remember the wonderful time we had together when we were young . I started writing to her about our picnic and the movie we saw together . I started remembering all the things we did together . It made me very happy . I finished the letter and got ready to go and post it . Nowadays most of the people have stopped writing letters . They all keep in touch through emails . Letters are something very personal . We can preserve the letters of our loved ones and some beautiful memories along with it .

Passage: We had just come home from the beach one Saturday afternoon . We had a great time , but were very sweaty , sandy and sticky with old sunscreen , sweat and salt from the ocean . After unpacking the car , I had to take a bath . I love our deep soaking tub . I put in the drain plug and started running the water , making sure the temperature of the water was just right , and put in my favorite bath scents and soap . When the tub was full , I immersed myself deep into the tub and just let my body soak for a while . It was good to sit in the nice , warm water and let everything just relax and melt away from me . I washed my hair with my favorite shampoo , as I had a lot of sand in it from playing at the beach that day . I scrubbed my body well with a washcloth , to get off all the sand and ocean salt that had dried on my skin , along with the sunscreen that I had been using . It was very relaxing and I felt really good . I then pulled the drain on the tub and let all the dirty water go down . I had a big , fluffy bath towel that I dried off in , and I put on clean clothes . I was ready to finish up our fun day with some dinner and good times with my family .

Passage: I own a giant , diesel , four door truck that is red in color and mean in appearance . I work construction for my job so I need to have something that is able to tow and haul a lot of weight . One of the unfortunate side effects of owning such a large , mean truck , however , is the need to constantly put fuel in it ! I usually go to the gas station twice a week to fill up my tank and empty my wallet . I pick a pump at my favorite gas station that is easy to drive into so I do n't risk hitting other vehicles . I hop out and insert my credit card into the pump machine . After my card is read , I pull the gas nozzle off of the machine and insert it into my truck . I wait for what seems like forever as the pump fills my tank and the dollar amount endlessly increases .

Passage: One morning , I got up and I was very tired . I decided to make a cup of coffee to wake myself up . Reaching in the fridge , I pulled out the coffee , placed a filter in the coffee maker and added the water to the machine . While the coffee maker made the coffee , I decided to pour myself a bowl of cereal . As I ate , the aroma of the coffee filled the kitchen with a rich , earthy smell , letting me know that my hot drink was ready . I quickly went to cabinet , pulled out my favorite mug , and filled it with coffee and just a little bit of creamer and sugar . After finishing my first cup of coffee , I poured a second cup into a thermos that I could take with me to work , and finished getting ready for the day .

Passage: This past month , I was very busy with planning a party for my younger brother . I had to find out a number of things , but the most important one was figuring out who I could invite to the party . After I had a good enough idea , I went to the store and bought several themed party invitations .

After finishing the writing and putting all of the invitations in envelopes , I put stamps on them so they could all be mailed out as soon as possible . I made sure that all of the invitations had stamps and the correct addresses of the people who would be getting them , and put them in my mailbox for the postman to take them to the post office to be sent off .

Passage: One of my lights in my lamp went out yesterday so I investigated to see what was the matter . I checked and the lamp was plugged and circuit breaker not tripped so I checked the bulb in the lamp . Further inspection revealed the bulb was brown so I knew it had burned out and needed replacement . Not having any extra in the house , I decided to go to the local Home Depot to buy the bulb I need . I checked the store and looked at the wide variety of available bulbs to purchase . I finally settled on a 75 Watt equal LED bulb and went to the counter to make my purchase . The clerk was friendly on check out and I got the five dollars from my wallet to buy the home . I then drove home and returned to my house . I found the lamp in my living room and unscrewed the old bulb in the lamp after making sure the lamp was turned off . I then screwed in the new light bulb , flipped the power switch , and the light came on . Voila !

Passage: Yesterday I decided to boil some milk so I could make cottage cheese . The first thing I did was select a pan to boil the milk . I decided to choose the widest pan I had , because the wider pan would let me boil the milk more quickly . It is important to select the right pan , a narrow pan will take longer for the milk to come to a boil and will increase the risk of burning the milk on the bottom of the pan . Once I selected the pan , I poured the milk into the pan , and turned the heat on the stove top to medium high heat . For the next ten minutes , I constantly stirred the milk as it heated , to evenly distribute heat and to reduce the risk of the milk burning in the pan . After ten minutes of heating , the milk came to a boil , so I removed the pan from the heat , ready to use my sterilized milk to make cottage cheese .

Passage: My friends and I love to go to the movie theater . Every Tuesday , the movie theaters have cheap days , where you can go see a movie for $ five , and then buy a drink and small snack for $ five too . So , we check online to see when the movies are playing , and we decide what we will see . Then , once we do that , we all go in the car and drive to the theater right before the movie begins . We park , and get out and stand in line for the tickets . We usually all buy our own tickets , and then go in and order a drink and snack . After that , we all go into the theater , and take our seats . The movie always has previews before the real movie begins , so we have time to talk a little before the movie starts . It also gives you time , if you were running late , to get there so you do n't miss the movie . We have a great time .

Passage: It was a sad day . June 's great Aunt Martha had died a few days ago , and today was the day they would have her funeral . Everyone in her family was dressed nicely , and made there way across town to the funeral home where the service would be held . As the entered the room , there was a strong smell of flowers that made June 's nose ache a little . Her mom signed a book with her and her brothers names , and they made there way into a parlor where other people had gathered . At the front of the room was a casket that was half way opened with Aunt Martha 's body lying in it . The family made there way up to the front of the room to look at Aunt Martha . She looked as if she was taking a nap in her finest clothes . Her make up and hair did n't really look like she used to wear them , but she did n't look scary like June had imagined . They met some family members that were sad and crying , but others were laughing and remembering funny stories about Aunt Martha . They made there way to a seat at the back of the parlor and a few songs were played while the curtains were drawn in the front of the room . When the curtains opened back up , the casket was closed with a large spray of flowers on top . A pastor stood up and said some really nice things about Aunt Martha , and prayed . The curtains closed again and the pastor told the crowd that the funeral would resume at Shady Oak Cemetery . Afterwards , the group of people that had gathered made there ways to their car for the funeral procession to the cemetery . June 's family followed a long line of cars following a hearse with Aunt Martha 's casket in the back . A police man escorted the group of cars , and stopped traffic so the funeral procession did n't have to stop at red lights on the way to the cemetery . As they pulled up to the gravesite , June saw a green tent with lots of folding chairs underneath , and a metal frame around a hole in the ground . The family gathered around the tent as the pallbearers carried Aunt Martha 's casket to the gravesite and placed it on the frame over the hole . The pastor said a few brief words and prayer again , and then Aunt Martha 's casket was lowered into the ground . The family talked a little while , and then drove over to Aunt Martha 's house to have a wake . There they ate food prepared by a local church for the family , and talked about the good times they had with Aunt Martha when she was alive .

Passage: It was a sad day . June 's great Aunt Martha had died a few days ago , and today was the day they would have her funeral . Everyone in her family was dressed nicely , and made there way across town to the funeral home where the service would be held . As the entered the room , there was a strong smell of flowers that made June 's nose ache a little . Her mom signed a book with her and her brothers names , and they made there way into a parlor where other people had gathered . At the front of the room was a casket that was half way opened with Aunt Martha 's body lying in it . The family made there way up to the front of the room to look at Aunt Martha . She looked as if she was taking a nap in her finest clothes . Her make up and hair did n't really look like she used to wear them , but she did n't look scary like June had imagined . They met some family members that were sad and crying , but others were laughing and remembering funny stories about Aunt Martha . They made there way to a seat at the back of the parlor and a few songs were played while the curtains were drawn in the front of the room . When the curtains opened back up , the casket was closed with a large spray of flowers on top . A pastor stood up and said some really nice things about Aunt Martha , and prayed . The curtains closed again and the pastor told the crowd that the funeral would resume at Shady Oak Cemetery . Afterwards , the group of people that had gathered made there ways to their car for the funeral procession to the cemetery . June 's family followed a long line of cars following a hearse with Aunt Martha 's casket in the back . A police man escorted the group of cars , and stopped traffic so the funeral procession did n't have to stop at red lights on the way to the cemetery . As they pulled up to the gravesite , June saw a green tent with lots of folding chairs underneath , and a metal frame around a hole in the ground .

Passage: I 'm hungry and I think I want some scrambled eggs . I need to get my ingredients first . I open the refrigerator and grab two eggs , butter , and the milk . I get my non - stick pan from the cabinet and a silicone spatula . I place a little butter in the pan and turn the stove on medium heat . As the pan begins to heat , I crack my eggs , add a little milk and mix thoroughly . I think my pan is ready and pour my eggs in while moving them slowly with the spatula .

Passage: My mom is teaching me to drive . First thing , we check to make sure the blinkers are working . I flipped the lever on the left side of the steering column up for the right blinker and down for the left . Both arrows under the speedometer blinked and on the outside of the car in the front and back . Next we got in and fastened our seat belts , then I checked the side mirrors and rear view to make sure I could see . I inserted the keys into the ignition and using my thumb and first finger pushed the switch forward . I checked the mirrors again to make sure all people , animals , and objects where out of the way . I pulled the gear shift towards me and pulled down one click going from P ( park ) to R ( reverse ) .

Passage: The previous night and this morning before work I noticed I was missing a lot of necessary ingredients for my future meals . I planned out a trip to the grocery store immediately after work . After I finished working I drove over to the store . It was very crowded but not too hard to find a parking spot . Once inside the store , I grabbed the nearest shopping cart and smiled as one of the grocery workers welcomed me in . Once inside and out of everyone 's way , I thought about what I needed . Since I did n't have a list written down , it took me a few minutes . Once I came up with the list in my head , I started to map out a route in my head that would take the least amount of time for me to follow in the store . First , I picked up my deli . They offered me some free samples of the meat I asked for . Then I picked up my bread which was right nearby . At the back wall of the store I found the meat I was going to cook tonight . After that , I grabbed a few extra items that I thought might also be nice later this week while heading towards checkout . Luckily , there was n't a line and this was done quickly . I paid with my debit card and left with all my groceries in a cart , packed them into my car , and headed home .

They then asked me if I would like delivery or pick up . I wanted to spend the evening relaxing after a long day and just watch movies with my pizza , so I opted for delivery . Twenty minutes later the delivery man arrived at my door with my pizza . I pull out my debit card and swiped it , because that was my preferred method of payment . I then had to sign for using my debt card , and also made sure I filled in the empty line that said tip bedside it . I made sure to leave the delivery man a generous one since he was here in a timely manner and was quite polite in dealing with me . After he proceeded back to his car , I sat down on the couch and ate my pizza while watching one of my favorite movies . It was a successful evening and the pizza was scrumptious !

Passage: Last night I invited some friends over for dinner . I decided to set the dining room table for dinner , rather than have us all eat around the coffee table in the living room like my partner and I usually do . First , I chose the tablecloth . We have a purple tablecloth , a light blue snowflake patterned tablecloth , and a bright colored floral tablecloth . I chose the floral one because I felt it was most appropriate for summertime . Next , I put a cloth napkin at each place and set utensils on top of the napkin - a knife , fork , and spoon . Then I placed a plate at each setting , four in total . I added a water glass at each setting as well . Then I put out the salt and pepper in the middle of the table so it was accessible to everyone . Lastly , I lit two candles and placed them in the center of the table as well . The dining room table looked great and ready for a dinner party .
Question: For how many people did they set the table for ?
*four  0.113869
 two  0.250024

Passage: It was a long day at work and I decided to stop at the gym before going home . I ran on the treadmill and lifted some weights . I decided I would also swim a few laps in the pool .

Passage: Last weekend , my friend and I decided it would be a good time to paper our living room . The previous residents of the house we live in had used wallpaper on the living room walls that was a very odd shade of red , which we thought looked strange . We wanted the living room to get a new color of wallpaper , and we wanted to choose a color that would match our personality . We first went to Sherwin - Williams , which is a paint and wallpaper store . We looked at the wallpaper color samples and picked up a few brochures with examples of how the samples would look on our walls . We decided that a cheery yellow color would look best on our walls , and selected that color . We then returned to Sherwin - Williams and purchased the yellow wallpaper . We then applied the wallpaper to our walls and stood back to admire our work .

Passage: I 'm in charge of preparing the picnic as we head to the lake . I have a lot of supplies I need to gather first . I need to fold up the waterproof tarp for the ground or picnic tables .

Passage: When you work in a restaurant , after the customers have paid the bill and left , you have to clean up the table and prepare it for the next customer . Sometimes it can be very easy if it was only one person , but if it was a large family it could be very messy . All the left over plates , cups and utensils need to be cleared away to the kitchen to be washed . The table top will also need to be wiped down of any food or spills , so it is fresh and clean for the next diners . And if there are placemats they too will need replacing . My favorite placemats are the ones you can color in , especially when they leave crayons on the table for you to use . Once the new place mats are down , a whole new table setting can be done . Often restaurants and cafes will have a special way they like their tables to be set up and its up to the wait staff to make sure that its done that way for every table . It may involve fancy folded napkins , or how the glasses or utensils get lined up . Some times it involves a whole new setting of plates , utensils and glasses and other times the table is bare except for the salt and pepper shakers . But regardless of what the restaurants table set up may look like , the table has to be ready so new customers can come in and enjoy their meal .

Passage: When you work in a restaurant , after the customers have paid the bill and left , you have to clean up the table and prepare it for the next customer . Sometimes it can be very easy if it was only one person , but if it was a large family it could be very messy . All the left over plates , cups and utensils need to be cleared away to the kitchen to be washed . The table top will also need to be wiped down of any food or spills , so it is fresh and clean for the next diners . And if there are placemats they too will need replacing . My favorite placemats are the ones you can color in , especially when they leave crayons on the table for you to use . Once the new place mats are down , a whole new table setting can be done . Often restaurants and cafes will have a special way they like their tables to be set up and its up to the wait staff to make sure that its done that way for every table . It may involve fancy folded napkins , or how the glasses or utensils get lined up . Some times it involves a whole new setting of plates , utensils and glasses and other times the table is bare except for the salt and pepper shakers . But regardless of what the restaurants table set up may look like , the table has to be ready so new customers can come in and enjoy their meal .

Passage: My family and I decided that the evening was beautiful so we wanted to have a bonfire . First , my husband went to our shed and gathered some dry wood . I placed camp chairs around our fire pit . Then my husband placed the dry wood in a pyramid shape inside the fire pit . He then set some small kindling ablaze using a long lighter . Once the kindling reached the dry wood , it set the wood on fire . We then sat around the fire for some time , adding more logs as the previous ones burned out . We cooked marshmallows on sticks over the open flames . When the marshmallows were golden brown , we placed them between two graham crackers with chocolate pieces . We ate our S'mores as we joked , laughed and told stories around our beautiful fire . When we finished , I put away our camp chairs . My husband made sure the fire was out by dousing it with some water and we went inside to bed .

Passage: I enjoy drinking tea . I made tea just this morning as a pleasant start to my day . I filled my kettle up with water and put it on the stove . I turned the heat all the way up so that the water would get hot quickly . When the kettle started to whistle , that let me know the water was hot . I poured the water into a mug , being very careful not to burn myself . I scooped out some tea leaves into a little tea infuser , which I put in my mug . After several minutes , I felt like the tea was probably strong enough to start drinking . I like to add a little honey to my tea to make it sweet .

Passage: Last night my air conditioner stopped working . It was so hot and sweaty while I was sleeping . It was clear when I woke up that I was going to have to change my sheets ! I took off the blankets , sheets and pillow cases . I took them all to the laundry room . I placed the into the washing machine . I added the proper amount of liquid laundry detergent . I like the stuff that has a really strong smell . I closed the lid and let it wash . After it was done , I removed them and placed the in the dryer with a fabric softener sheet . They took an hour to dry . I removed them while they were still warm and carried them to my room . I placed the fitted sheet on , as the corners played a game of popping off as I ran from corner to corner putting it back on . I then put the flat sheet on , the blankets on the pillow cases on and top a moment to lay on top of the fresh bedding and just smell it for a minute . That is the best smell in the world .

We found flights we wanted and set to making our reservation . We made sure the flights we liked had two seats available , and we got to choose where on the airplane we got to sit . We choose two seats together in row 10 , a window seat and a middle . While the middle seat is n't as much fun as the window it meant we could sit together . Now that we had our seats , for the way there , we then picked out seats for the way home and we were able to pick the same ones . Now with both flights selected , we went to the payment page and paid for the seats with a credit card . With the flights paid for , we could print out our tickets for our trip to Florida .

Passage: I went out to eat at a restaurant last weekend with my husband . We went to a place that is pretty popular in town and has gotten really good reviews . We had to wait a few minutes for a table , but soon enough we were seated . The restaurant had a warm and friendly feel , and our waiter appeared right after we were seated . She was warm and friendly too . She greeted us and asked for our drink orders . My husband just wanted water , but I got an unsweet tea with lemon . We chose not to order an appetizer , but the waitress brought our drinks and a basket of rolls for us to snack on . We ordered our entrees then , having had time to study the menu . My husband got a steak and baked potato with a side of steamed broccoli and I ordered the salmon and wild rice . Our waitress took the order , then promised to have our food out soon . We sampled the bread while she was gone . The rolls were delicious and the tea was refreshing . My husband and I began talking about how our days had been and discussing moving , which we are in the middle of currently . We talked for a few minutes until our food arrived , then settled down to eat . I had only taken a bite of my fish , however , when I realized that something was wrong . The smell was off and it had a bad taste . I thought it must be bad . I waited until our waitress was coming back by , then I asked her if she would take it back and bring me something different , because I felt like the salmon was going bad . She agreed and I ordered a steak like my husband got . He said his was delicious . The waitress took the fish and apologized profusely . She brought my steak out very shortly and it was fantastic . She kept checking on us throughout the meal , and the manager even came over to offer us a free dessert . He apologized for the salmon and said that the cook had made a mistake and pulled from the stock that was about to be thrown away . We accepted the free dessert , New York - style cheesecake . It was so creamy and sweet . We enjoyed our meal , overall . Our waitress brought us out ticket and even marked down our meal . We tipped generously and left satisfied .

Passage: Going to the dentist was hard for Mike . He was a little bit afraid of going , but his mom always went with him . When he got to the dentist office , they were all nice to him . He had to go sit in a dentist chair , and lean back for the lady to check his teeth . Then she started to clean his teeth with a little machine and a little stick . The machine made a whirring sound , but it was just water in it , and it washed his mouth out when she finished . She then rubbed his teeth with a buffer , that made his teeth shine . It tasted like bubble gum . He liked that part . Then the dentist came in and examined his mouth , to make sure the lady cleaned them well . He was also checking for cavities .

Passage: I always want to cook and finally I did it last night . I chose to have an egg - drop soup since it should be easy to do and great to taste . I prepared all ingredients : two scrambled eggs on a bowl , one teaspoon of corn starch mixed with water , a handful of chopped green onion , one teaspoon of sesame oil , a half teaspoon of salt , a teaspoon of soy sauce . I placed them in sequence of cooking order so I could just keep pouring them into the pot without messing up orders . Darn , I missed the most important item - boiling water . With water started boiling in the pot , I began putting ingredients in as plan . The soup finished good , but still seemed to be missing something . Oh , it was the white pepper power and black vinegar . It was not too late to add them in . With the final touch , it tasted much better . That was not too bad for my first soup .

Passage: If there ’s one cleaning task I used to put off the most , it was definitely cleaning the shower . I mixed up a batch of the homemade shower cleaner and sprayed it liberally my bathroom shower , which needed some serious help at the time . The homemade shower cleaner consist of a spray bottle , one cup of dawn dishwasher liquid and one cup of vinegar and regular water . After I sprayed my homemade solution around the shower I let it sit for around an hour . After an hour , I grabbed a scrubbing brush and began to scrub away all the mildew stains that were in the shower . I find it best that you have the bathroom well - ventilated when you start scrubbing because you do n't want to inhale all those nasty chemicals when your scrubbing away at your shower . After I finished scrubbing away all the shower gunk I turned on the shower and let all the dirty water and cleaning agents flow into the shower drain .

The homemade shower cleaner consist of a spray bottle , one cup of dawn dishwasher liquid and one cup of vinegar and regular water . After I sprayed my homemade solution around the shower I let it sit for around an hour . After an hour , I grabbed a scrubbing brush and began to scrub away all the mildew stains that were in the shower . I find it best that you have the bathroom well - ventilated when you start scrubbing because you do n't want to inhale all those nasty chemicals when your scrubbing away at your shower . After I finished scrubbing away all the shower gunk I turned on the shower and let all the dirty water and cleaning agents flow into the shower drain .

Passage: I decided to go camping tomorrow night . To prepare , we needed to get some supplies . We took our sleeping bags from the closet , and put them in the trunk of the car . We packed a bag with food ; snacks like pretzels , canned beans and corn , sandwiches , fruit and some water . We carried blankets , flashlights , hats and gloves to the car , and packed a separate bag with clothes and extra shoes . We made sure that we had a map that would direct us to the campsite , and extra batteries for our flashlights . We were only staying one night , but had to make sure we were prepared for cold weather and had enough food . When the car was packed , we went to the gas station to put extra gas in our car to make sure we would have enough to get to and from the campsite the next day . We would sleep that night , and tomorrow morning would pack our pillows , tooth brushes and toothpaste , get dressed and get in the car to drive to the campsite .

Passage: Billy decided he wanted to hang his new painting of a locomotive in his bedroom , he had the perfect spot picked , right above the cat tree in the corner of his bedroom . He held the picture up to the wall finding the perfect spot and marked the center of it with a pencil so he knew where the nail should go . Billy then went to his hallway closet where he had a small dresser where he kept his tools and he picked up a hammer , a nail , and a level . Billy then gently tapped the nail into the wall with the nail angled upwards a little to help hold the picture in place with his hammer being careful not to tap the nail in to the wall too far as it would’ve been hard for him to pull out . He then hung the picture on the nail and used the level on the bottom of the picture so he could make sure the picture was straight on the wall .

Passage: My wife had a stressful week at work and the weekend had finally come . I knew she needed to relax and feel pampered , so I arranged for us to visit the local sauna . I surprised her with the news and she seemed very happy . We both put on some comfortable clothing and headed to our relaxing retreat . When we got there the attendant took our information and asked what services we would be needing . I arranged for massages for both of us and we were given locker keys and robes . We parted ways to go into the appropriate locker rooms and change into our robes and the swimwear we brought along . After changing we had our massages , relaxing all parts of our bodies . Then we both went into a private sauna room and closed the wooden door . There was a pot of hot coals in the middle of the room and we had been instructed how to use it . I took a ladle of water from the pedestal in the corner and poured it on the hot coals . Steam poured out of the coals and filled the warm room . Soon the sauna was filled with warm soothing steam and we both laid down together on the benches and took in the sensations .

Passage: An unfortunate truth of life is that some day we all die . Sadly , I lost my grandmother a couple weeks ago . She was in poor health for the past eight years due to a stroke , and a second major stroke several weeks prior to her death left her completely incapacitated . It was a long distance to get to Wisconsin , so I flew out from New York the day before the wake . All my family was there , including my aunts , uncles , cousins , and parents . The wake was sad , but my family put together photos and a video from my grandmother 's life , and we talked about the good times we remembered . The following morning , we attended the funeral , where my uncle gave a eulogy , the pastor gave a sermon , and we sang some of grandma 's favorite hymns . We then drove in a procession , or long line of cars , to the graveyard , where we said our final goodbyes and cried . Funerals are always sad , but we get to reminisce on memories of good times with our departed loved ones .

She was in poor health for the past eight years due to a stroke , and a second major stroke several weeks prior to her death left her completely incapacitated . It was a long distance to get to Wisconsin , so I flew out from New York the day before the wake . All my family was there , including my aunts , uncles , cousins , and parents . The wake was sad , but my family put together photos and a video from my grandmother 's life , and we talked about the good times we remembered . The following morning , we attended the funeral , where my uncle gave a eulogy , the pastor gave a sermon , and we sang some of grandma 's favorite hymns . We then drove in a procession , or long line of cars , to the graveyard , where we said our final goodbyes and cried . Funerals are always sad , but we get to reminisce on memories of good times with our departed loved ones .

Passage: I was driving home from work when I noticed that the low fuel light on my dashboard had turned on . I needed to stop for gas otherwise I probably would n't make it back to my house .

As I was driving , I looked for a gas station . When I found one with good , affordable gas prices , I turned in and pulled up next to a gas pump . I took my wallet out of my purse and got out of my car . I swiped my credit card at the pump and chose the type of fuel that I wanted . I put the gas pump into my car and began fueling . My gas tank was almost empty so it took awhile for my tank to fill up . The gas pump clicked off automatically when my tank was full , and I took the pump out and put it back in its place .

Passage: My shower was filthy and grimy . Whoa ! All that shower dirt had to go . So what I did was , I went over to my local Walmart , and I bought a sponge , a pair of rubber gloves , any empty five gallon bucket , bleach and shower spray cleaner . I gathered those things and bought them all , and all cost me 9.89 in total , including tax for these shower cleaning supplies . I headed back home , filled a bucket up with two gallons of hot water , and added two tablespoons of bleach and about a quarter cup of shower cleaner . After that I put on some rubber gloves onto my hands in order to protect them from the harsh chemicals . I then put the sponge deep into the bucket cleaning solution , and then proceeded to scrub my shower with the dousing wet sponge . I rubbed out all of the grime out of the shower with the wet , chemically treated sponge . After I completed the scrub down , it was time to rinse , so I simply ran the shower head with lukewarm water in order to drain all the grime down the shower drain . After that , my shower was finally clean , grime free and looked like new !

Passage: My little boy was sick , his tummy hurt and he needed medicine to feel better . I went to the medicine cabinet and looked for the stomach medicine . I read the directions and took the bottle into the kitchen . It has a measuring cup on the top , so I took it off and placed it on the counter . I opened the bottle of medicine , then picked the cup up and looked at the measuring lines to see what dose to give him . I held the cup at eye level and poured the medicine in the cup . I checked to make sure it had the right amount and placed the cup back on the counter . I replaced the lid on the medicine . I took him the medicine and told him to drink it . He drank the medicine . I took the cup when he was done and washed it out . I put the cup back on top of the medicine bottle and took the bottle back to the bathroom . I opened the medicine cabinet and put it back in its place .

Passage: On a hot summer day nothing is better then going to a swimming pool . There is one at the community center by us so we can walk there . Before we go , we get into our bathing suits and put on our flip flops . We make sure to pack snacks , and towels and drinks into a bag , and grab a float and a ball to play with . We walk to the pool , the hot day making us even more excited to going swimming . Once there , we hurry to find empty lounge chairs to put our towels on and waste no time getting into the pool . The water feels so cold at first , but its so refreshing . We swim around and realize we have friends there . We play a game with the ball for a while before getting out for snacks . We dry out in the sun while we eat and drink and when we are hot again we get back into the water to swim some more . Going to the swimming pool on hot days is the best way to stay cool and have fun too .

Passage: On a bright , sunny Monday morning I put on some light clothes and headed outside to mow my lawn . I opened the garage door , put on my sunglasses , and grabbed a bottle of cold water . I gassed up the lawn mower with my portable gas tank . I pushed the mower into the yard where I normally started to mow . I cranked to mower , and on the third try it started . I pushed the mower back and forth throughout my yard , creating straight and conformed lines .

Passage: I had to clean the floor yesterday . Sometimes it seems like a big chore , but once I start it does not seem that hard . I have a lot of throw rugs and pick them up first before cleaning the floor . I fold the rugs so that any dirt in them does not get on the floor . I like to sweep . I sweep all around the floor and even along the wall and corners of the room very well . I saw a spill mark in the kitchen and got a damp paper towel to clean up the mark . It took some scrubbing but finally came off the floor . I went outside to shack out my throw rugs . It was a nice day outside . I vacuumed my big rugs . Some of my floor needed to be mopped , so I did that and let the floors dry . I will try not to get the floors dirty .

Passage: Today I woke up and decided to make bacon and eggs for breakfast . I walked to the kitchen and got out all of the ingredient I needed , which included , eggs , bacon , cheese , onion , and green pepper .

I also put the bacon in the frying pan and flipped each piece after several minutes . Once the bacon was cooked , I poured the veggies and egg mixture into the pan , stirring occasionally , until the mixture set up and was solid .

Passage: Just recently , the light in my hallway went out , and since my younger brother is afraid of sleeping in the dark , this became an unnecessary problem . In order to calm him down , my dad went to the nearest hardware store to buy a brand new light bulb . He needed to make sure that the light bulb was the right size , so he took the old , burned out light bulb with him to compare . After finding the right size bulb , he paid for it and brought it back home . He then grabbed a nearby chair so that he could stand on to reach the empty socket where the bulb would go . He had me turn off the light switch , which would make sure that he would not get electrocuted while putting the bulb on or burned when it turns on . After less than five minutes , he is finished screwing in the bulb . We flip the switch to see if it works , and it does . My brother was now relieved .

Passage: After an extremely hard week at work , I decided that I wanted to treat myself to something nice . For this something nice , I decided to go to a sauna . I had never been to a sauna before but I had heard a lot of my friends talk about how much they loved it and how relaxing it was for them , so I figured I would give it a try . I got to the sauna and was greeted by a very calm and soothing employee who first directed me to a massage room . I waited and got a great massage which made me very relaxed and ready to go into the sauna . I entered the sauna and the first thing I noticed was that it smelled very woody , almost like being deep in a forest . It was also very hot inside but it was n't unpleasant . I sat down in the corner and closed my eyes , trying to relax . I spent about thirty minutes in the sauna enjoying the heat and took a shower when I was finally ready to leave .

I accessed the American Airlines website and entered the desired dates of my flight . The website then provided me a bunch of different flight options for both my departing and returning flights . I selected the flights that worked the best for me and were the most affordable and I selected them . I was then directed to pay for my flight which I did via my American Airlines credit card . Once my flight was paid for I received an email confirming my transaction and providing me my flight details . I find that using the internet is much easier than calling the airlines for a flight reservation .

Passage: We spent a week getting our gear together for our big camping trip . After making sure everything was packed and the tent had no holes from the last trip , we put everything into the car and set out on our way . After a four hour drive we arrived at the campgrounds . We found our spot and unpacked the car . First up was pitching the tent , then we set about making a fire to cook dinner . It took awhile to collect all the wood we needed and get it roaring , but once we got the food on the fire we could finally relax . After soaking in nature and enjoying our campfire meal , night had fallen and it was time for bed . We curled up in our sleeping bags and told scary stories until we drifted off . The next morning we awoke early to stoke the fire and get breakfast started . A day of hiking and fishing went by far too fast and after another night under the stars we packed up our gear and headed home .

Passage: One evening , I noticed my alarm clock had stopped working , because I had just checked the clock in the living room , and my alarm clock showed a different time . I knew I had to change the batteries . This is important as I need it to wake me up in time for work . I grabbed the clock , turned it upside down and located the slot for the batteries . I lifted the plastic cover and checked what batteries it required : two AA - sized batteries . These are quite common , and I got them from the kitchen drawer . I removed the old batteries by lifting them up , then I placed the new batteries in the same position , making sure the plus - side of the batteries ( the little tip ) were in the right direction , as it is usually engraved on the plastic . I closed the lid carefully , and the clock started ticking again . I adjusted the time with the help of my watch , and went to bed , knowing I would be woken up by my alarm at the right time the next morning .

Passage: It was a very hot sunny Saturday morning and me and my family decide to go to the beach . Before going to the beach we had to pack the car . We packed some snacks . We packed a cooler with all our drinks and water . We put on our bathing suits and brought towels , beach chairs , a beach umbrella , beach toys , and a beach ball . Mom brought sun tan lotion to protect us from the sun . Once we got to the beach mom and dad setup all off the chairs , umbrella and towels . Mom laid down on a towel while dad went running to the ocean . We swam but not too far because the water was very deep . There were a lot of waves and some people there were surfing with surfboards . There was other people that were playing volleyball on the beach and there were a lot of kids building sand castles . Dad helped us build our sand castle with a pool so that when the waves came in it would fill in our pool . At the beach there was also a tower for the lifeguards to see everyone in the water . There was a guy who went out too far into the water that the lifeguard had to blow his whistle for the guy to come closer to the beach . I have heard that sometimes you can see shark in the ocean but lucky for us we did not see any sharks . Visiting the beach was very fun for the whole family as mom can relax and get a tan and dad could play and swim with us .

Passage: Yesterday I hosted a barbecue for about twenty people . It was a really fun event and I enjoyed having my friends over to my beach house . To prepare for the barbecue I went shopping at the grocery store for hamburgers , hotdogs , rolls , chips , salad and soda . When I returned from the store I prepared the salads and laid all of the food out to be cooked on the grill . As my friends began to arrive one of them volunteered to cook all of the food while the rest of us socialized and played volley ball . As the food was prepared we all enjoyed eating a burger or hot dog and then we quickly returned to playing different lawn games such as croquet and horseshoes . After a few hours my friends decided that it was time to go home . We really had a fun afternoon and I am excited to host a few more barbecues this summer .
Question: What type of food was barbecued ?

As my friends began to arrive one of them volunteered to cook all of the food while the rest of us socialized and played volley ball . As the food was prepared we all enjoyed eating a burger or hot dog and then we quickly returned to playing different lawn games such as croquet and horseshoes . After a few hours my friends decided that it was time to go home . We really had a fun afternoon and I am excited to host a few more barbecues this summer .

Passage: In the morning I felt hungry and decided to make myself some scrambled eggs for breakfast . I took out a carton of eggs from the refrigerator and placed it on the counter . From the carton , I took three eggs and inspected them for cracks . They looked fine , so I cracked them into a small bowl being careful to to have any shells in it . I added a splash of water and then began to scramble the eggs with a whisk . Next I heated up a frying pan with a little butter in it . Once the pan was hot , I poured my eggs in it . After adding a dash of salt and pepper , I kept scrambling the eggs . Occasionally i would remove the pan from heat while scrambling for a short moment . Once the eggs looks firm and ready , I turned off the stove and plated my eggs to enjoy . I added a small sprig of parsley to the plate to make it look even fancier .

Passage: Sometimes for dinner I like to have fish instead of chicken or beef . When I want to have fish for dinner I will go to my local fish market and pick out something I like . Some times it might be salmon , sometimes tuna , or maybe a white fish like tilapia or flounder . I will buy a pound of it , and the fish monger will wrap it in wax paper and put it in a bag for me . Once I have it home , I check it , finding it clean and not smelling at all like fish . I will put it in a glass casserole dish and season it with salt , pepper , garlic , lemon , vinegar and olive oil . I might put a few onions in with it . I will turn on the oven and while the oven gets hot I will make a salad . Once the oven is hot I will put the fish inside and set a timer . While the fish bakes , I will make other side dishes . When the timer rings I know its done and I carefully take it out with oven mitts . It smells so good of garlic and its nice and cooked through .

Passage: Sometimes for dinner I like to have fish instead of chicken or beef . When I want to have fish for dinner I will go to my local fish market and pick out something I like . Some times it might be salmon , sometimes tuna , or maybe a white fish like tilapia or flounder . I will buy a pound of it , and the fish monger will wrap it in wax paper and put it in a bag for me . Once I have it home , I check it , finding it clean and not smelling at all like fish . I will put it in a glass casserole dish and season it with salt , pepper , garlic , lemon , vinegar and olive oil . I might put a few onions in with it . I will turn on the oven and while the oven gets hot I will make a salad . Once the oven is hot I will put the fish inside and set a timer . While the fish bakes , I will make other side dishes . When the timer rings I know its done and I carefully take it out with oven mitts . It smells so good of garlic and its nice and cooked through . While I set the table , I let it cool and after a few minutes I serve my self a piece and my salad and side dishes .

Passage: When I was younger , my mom wanted to make sure I would be safe around water . She took me to the swimming pool to get better at it .

Sometimes , I would get bored when my siblings would swim , so I brought the book The Lord of the Rings with me to read if I was bored .

Passage: The other day , my friend wanted to go outside . I suggested that we go and play tennis . He said that he had some racquets that we could play with , so I told him to bring them . I drove to the tennis court that was at the park and we got ready to play . I brought some balls to hit and he gave me a racquet to play with .

Passage: I decided that for Mother 's Day I wanted to make a camping trip , so I called the camping grounds to reserve a space . Once I confirmed that our space was reserved for our trip , I began to pack our belongings in art suitcases . I packed pillows , bed sheets , pillows , food , medicine , toiletries , shoes , and anything else that I felt we needed to have with us while we were away . Additionally , I ensure that we had bug repellent spray , hats and jackets to protect ourselves while out in the wild . We also brought pots , pans , gallons of water , eating utensils and even an electric griddle so that we could cook and eat- even if we did not have a stove or oven . Once everything was packed , the luggage was all packed into the back of the truck , I also had to gather the camping tent , foldable chairs and sleeping bags for our trip , and load them into the truck as well . The last thing I needed to pack was some canned and nonperishable foods that could be cooked , along with things such as bread , snacks , soda and juice .

Passage: I decided that for Mother 's Day I wanted to make a camping trip , so I called the camping grounds to reserve a space . Once I confirmed that our space was reserved for our trip , I began to pack our belongings in art suitcases . I packed pillows , bed sheets , pillows , food , medicine , toiletries , shoes , and anything else that I felt we needed to have with us while we were away . Additionally , I ensure that we had bug repellent spray , hats and jackets to protect ourselves while out in the wild . We also brought pots , pans , gallons of water , eating utensils and even an electric griddle so that we could cook and eat- even if we did not have a stove or oven . Once everything was packed , the luggage was all packed into the back of the truck , I also had to gather the camping tent , foldable chairs and sleeping bags for our trip , and load them into the truck as well . The last thing I needed to pack was some canned and nonperishable foods that could be cooked , along with things such as bread , snacks , soda and juice . Now that we have covered everything from sleeping arrangements , clothing and food , and it was all packed in the truck and ready to go , the only thing left to do now was get in the truck and drive off on our way to our reservation .

Passage: It was a cool spring evening and we wanted to have a family get together on the beach around a bonfire . After getting permission from the city , we began to plan the night . First we went to a local man and bought all of the necessary bonfire wood , which is much bigger than the logs that would go into a fireplace . We went to the grocery store to pick up all of the necessary ingredients for a cookout next to the bonfire . We bought burgers , hot dogs , and buns for each . We made sure we had every vegetable available to go onto a burger including condiments and cheeses . We picked up several bags of chips and ingredients for s'mores . We arrived at the beach just before sunset and built the bonfire with the very long logs . Once we felt like they were all in place , we lit the fire and began to cook so everything would be ready for our guests once they arrived .

Passage: We were excited about the awesome new mall and planned all week to visit it this past weekend ! I called my sisters and friends and we all decided to meet in the front at noon on Saturday . There was plenty of parking and nice security cameras to keep us safe . We walked in the first large store and everyone decided to split up and meet at the food court two hours later . Alone , I looked at the ladies shoes . I bought a pair of dress up shoes and walked over to the nearby makeup . They were having a promotion so I bought my favorite kind to get a free bag and then checked out a new kind before I bought some and lipstick . Both were priced great . Next , I went to the housewares section and bought a coffee maker in black . Hand mixers were on sale across the isle so I bought one for the camp . The color I chose is red to match the blender . Next , I left the large store and went to nearby children 's store to pick out toys for my kids . Four games and two balls looked great and exactly what they would like . Then I spotted some outdoor clothing and searched for something to give me to a little relief from daily laundry . After I went to a wonderful new ladies purse store and bought a new Gucci for the job interview ahead , I realized it was time to meet at the food court . Realizing it was all the way across the mall , I hurriedly walked that way and saw my friends and sisters standing in front waiting . We shared some strawberry ice cream and coffee before we walked back to our cars and said goodbye . As I drove home and thought about my purchases and good time with friends and family , I smiled .

Passage: Yesterday I woke up and decided to wear my favorite cardigan sweater to work . After taking a shower and eaten breakfast I started getting dressed . I put on a pair of jeans and then I reached for my favorite black cardigan . As I began to button it up I realized that one of the buttons had fallen off . Of course I did not want to wear any other sweater , just this one as it was my favorite . I went to my spare room and dug my sewing kit out of the dresser . I found a thread and button that would match and I quickly threaded a needle . I began to methodically move the needle through the holes in the button to sew it back onto the sweater . After a few minutes I cut the thread and secured the button to the sweater . Finally I was able to put my sweater on and head off to work .

Of course I did not want to wear any other sweater , just this one as it was my favorite . I went to my spare room and dug my sewing kit out of the dresser . I found a thread and button that would match and I quickly threaded a needle . I began to methodically move the needle through the holes in the button to sew it back onto the sweater . After a few minutes I cut the thread and secured the button to the sweater . Finally I was able to put my sweater on and head off to work .

Passage: My wife and I flew on an airplane a couple of months ago . We were going to Las Vegas because a friend of mine was getting married . He lives there and said that he would pick us up from the airport . But , the weather here was cold and there was freezing rain , so our flight was delayed for two hours . It was kind of scary taking off because the weather was still cold and rainy , but after two hours of sitting there waiting , I was ready to go . People on the flight were pretty happy to finally leave and a lot of people were having drinks . Everyone was getting ready for their own little party in Las Vegas . The flight itself took a little over four hours due to the fact that we had a non - stop flight . I was glad I paid the extra money for not making any stops . Six hours sitting on an airplane is more than enough for me . The flight was pretty uneventful except for the lively passengers , so that was a good thing , especially since my wife hates to fly . My friend ended up still picking us up from the airport and we had a great time in Las Vegas .

Passage: I wanted to spruce up my house before my team members from work came over for a training . I had three paintings of plumeria flowers waiting to be hung on the wall . These paintings were very special to me . A friend gave them to me . They use to hang in her house that she recently sold . I was happy to receive them and hang them in my house . I first decided which wall would best display the pictures . I picked the wall in the dining room . I put the paintings on the floor at the base of the wall to see how I would space the paintings . I then asked my daughter to hold one painting up so I could measure the distance from the ceiling with a measuring tape . I measure the distance and marked the wall with a pencil . I hammered a nail on the mark and then hung my pictures .

Passage: We normally set a menu on Sunday for each day of the upcoming week to avoid chaos during dinner time . Before I leave for the day in the morning , I am sure to put out the ingredients I need for the dinner ahead of time and defrost any meat I may need to prepare the meal . At around five - thirty , I begin preparing the meal . One meal I prepare often is ground turkey meatloaf and seasoned green beans . I mix the ground turkey with some bread crumbs , ketchup , and a bit of egg to bind it . I also lightly season it for flavor . I push it into the loaf pan , and put it in the oven to cook . I then begin preparing the seasoned green beans . I like to use fresh green beans . They may involve the extra work of snapping off the ends before cooking them , but they taste so much fresher . I season them with red pepper flakes and a little bit of lemon juice . When the oven dings , dinner is ready for my family and I to enjoy .

Another part of the museum had skeletons from all different kinds of old animals -- dinosaurs , a sabretooth tiger , and even a mammoth ! The plaques next to them told me all about when and where the animals lived . While I was at the museum , I moved from one room to the next and took my time to read as much as I could so I could really enjoy the trip .

Passage: I was reading a great book in my favorite chair when suddenly the light went out . I flicked the switch on my reading lamp , but it did me no good . It looked like that light bulb had burned out . I went to the hall closet and poked around , and luckily I found just what I needed , a package of light bulbs just like the one that had burned out . I brought one of the new bulbs back to the living room , and unscrewed the old used - up light bulb . I put it on the kitchen counter so I would see it in the morning and remember to recycle it at our city 's transfer station .

 no  0.773275

Passage: I was reading a great book in my favorite chair when suddenly the light went out . I flicked the switch on my reading lamp , but it did me no good . It looked like that light bulb had burned out . I went to the hall closet and poked around , and luckily I found just what I needed , a package of light bulbs just like the one that had burned out . I brought one of the new bulbs back to the living room , and unscrewed the old used - up light bulb . I put it on the kitchen counter so I would see it in the morning and remember to recycle it at our city 's transfer station . Then I screwed the new light bulb into the light socket and turned on the lamp . The light shone bright and clear . I settled back into my chair with a sigh , and opened my book again .

Passage: My hair is dirty and feels oily when I touch it today , so it is time to wash it . I like washing my hair in the shower because it is much easier than in a bath tub . I turn the shower on and make sure the water is nice and warm , but not too hot . I step in the shower and get my hair nice and wet . It is good to use shampoo and conditioner . First , I take some shampoo that I like and rub it onto my head . This cleans the part of the hair that is close to your head and also cleans the skin there that gets oily . After the shampoo is rubbed into my head , I let the water from the shower rinse out all the soap . Once the soap is out , I take some conditioner and rub it into the longer parts of my hair and the ends . This keeps it nice and soft and healthy . I let the conditioner sit in my hair for a while , and then rinse it all out in the warm water . I dry off , and feel better knowing that my hair is nice and clean again .

Passage: This morning , like any other morning , I woke up still tired . Coffee is something I require daily to function . Up until last year , I used a regular coffee pot , and would brew about six cups , and drink most of it . Last year , for my birthday , I got a Keurig machine that brews individual cups .

Passage: In my English class I was recently assigned to read the book brave new world . My first idea was to just buy it but when I went to the local bookstore it cost $ 20 . $ 20 for a book is more than I am willing to pay so I decided to go to the local library . Calling in ahead to make sure that they did indeed have the book that I wanted , I then headed in the direction of the library . When I arrive they had already had the book up front as I requested so that all I had to do was go pick it up . Or so I thought . In actuality I had to spend time getting a new library card . The librarian walked me through the process while also giving me a little background on the book I was about to read . After I had gotten my new library card I simply gave it to the librarian and she checked out the book for me . Now it is time to dig in to this novel

Passage: For my anniversary with my husband , I decided to cook him a very fancy and nice breakfast . One thing I had always wanted to do but never got to try was making fresh squeezed orange juice . I figured that our anniversary would be the perfect time to try this ! I went to my local farmer 's market and got the biggest , juiciest oranges I could find . I got about ten oranges because I was n't sure how much I was going to need to make enough juice for both me and my husband . I got home and pulled my juicer out from underneath my sink . It was still in the box since it was a wedding gift I had never had a chance to use ! I was excited to try it . I sliced all of my oranges in half and plugged the juicer in . I began using the juicer to squeeze the juice out of my orange juice . To my luck , I only needed about five oranges to make enough juice for me and my husband so I saved the rest of the oranges for later . I brought my husband his breakfast with the orange juice , and he said that the juice was his favorite part !

We wanted to cook them , so we cleaned them out of all the nasty stuff in their body and started a fire . When the fire was getting calmed down , the hot coals started to steam . When it started steaming , we got the fish out and put it on a cast iron pan . We put the pan on the middle of the fire with the lid on it and we waited while the fish cooked . It smelled really good to us , especially with how hungry that we were . After it started to smell almost burned , we took the pan off of the fire with hot gloves and ate the fish inside when cooled .

Passage: While casually browsing through my friends pictures online I discovered a new revelation . They are called Lush bath bombs and the are colorful scented fizz balls . I quickly ordered a few online from their website and when they came I was overcome with excitement . I brought a Pink Potion one with a flower inside and a Blue Dream glitter one . I put the Hello Kitty tub stopper in my bath tub and ran my bathwater until the tub was halfway full . Then I dropped the bath bomb in the water and was anointed by the wonderful smell of lavender . The water in the tub fizzled with pretty blue glitter . I got in an soaked for more than an hour and got out feeling like a million bucks .

Passage: Time to make breakfast ! I 'll get the coffee started because it will be the perfect temperature by the time all the food is done . I grind the beans and put filtered water into the electric kettle and get it started . I need to put a filter in the Chemex and pour in my ground coffee beans . Meanwhile , I 'll gather my ingredients from the fridge . I want eggs , butter , English Muffins , and Canadian bacon . A breakfast sandwich sounds good . I 'll get the English muffins toasted in the toaster . My water just finished boiling , so it 's time to pour that in the Chemex over the ground beans . I need to get the frying pan and put a little butter in there and turn on the pan . I grab and egg and scramble with a fork . My pan is heating and the butter is melting I put my egg in and swirl it to cover the bottom of the pan . While I wait for my eggs to set up , I 'm going to microwave my Canadian bacon . Back to the eggs , they are almost set so I 'll fold them into a half circle and flip . Grab my toasted English muffins on a plate . Layer my Canadian bacon and fold my freshly cooked eggs on top . I 'll pour myself a cup of coffee and now I can sit down for breakfast . Looks good .

Passage: I love shopping online . Last weekend I wanted to order some vitamins . I looked on two web sites to find exactly the kind of vitamins I wanted . And I also looked at prices . I even tried to find some near me so that they would be shipped to me quick . The quickest way to get them and not have to pay too much money would cause them to get to me in four days . So I decided to order and wait . On Monday morning there was a package by my front door . I opened it . It was the vitamins . It took less than 24 hours for them to get to me . I was happy the vitamins were here . I tried to figure out how they go to me so quick . Then I figured out that they came from an Amazon facility near me . I might order from Amazon again since they got here quick .

Passage: Last night I decided to make Mexican Bean Salad for dinner . This is a really nice , light , and flavorful dish to eat during the summer . I looked up the recipe and took out a notepad and a pen so I could make a list of all of the ingredients I needed to get at the grocery store on my way home from work . Some of the ingredients I already had - like olive oil , red wine vinegar , garlic , and cumin . However , I needed many of the other necessary ingredients in order to make the recipe . On my shopping list , I wrote that I needed one can of black beans , one can of kidney beans , one can of cannellini beans , a bag of frozen corn , one red onion , one green bell pepper , one red bell pepper , and one bunch of cilantro . I put the shopping list in my purse so I could reference it later at the store and make sure I buy everything that I need for dinner .

Passage: This morning when I woke up , I noticed something was strange about my alarm clock . Instead of being loud , like normal , it was fairly faint , and changing volume on it 's own . The light was also flickering a lot on the time readout . I figured that the batteries were probably dying , so I decided to change them . First , I looked in my cabinet to see if I had any spare batteries . I did n't , so I drove to the grocery store to pick up some replacements . I bought two AA batteries , and returned home with them . I found my flat head screwdriver in my tool box , and used it to pry open the battery compartment on the bottom of my alarm clock . I then dislodged the old batteries with my fingers , and placed the new ones in the slots , with the positive and negative ends lining up appropriately . Finally , I put the battery cover back on and saw the alarm clock light up brightly .

First , I looked in my cabinet to see if I had any spare batteries . I did n't , so I drove to the grocery store to pick up some replacements . I bought two AA batteries , and returned home with them . I found my flat head screwdriver in my tool box , and used it to pry open the battery compartment on the bottom of my alarm clock . I then dislodged the old batteries with my fingers , and placed the new ones in the slots , with the positive and negative ends lining up appropriately . Finally , I put the battery cover back on and saw the alarm clock light up brightly .
Question: How many batteries did the clock need ?
*two batteries  0.511056
 six batteries  0.425849

Passage: I was invited for a party , and I had a very nice dress that I decided to wear . But when I saw , it has one button missing . So I had to fix it . That button had four holes , so I wanted to fix in such a way that it looks good . So I had to choose exact matching color with my dress . The button was golden . I started to sew it on back side so , the knot will not show up . Then I poke my needle in one of the hole and stretched my thread all the way , then I inserted the needle in to the opposite side of hole . When it went down , I pulled it all the way , and then , got it out from the hole as which was empty so far , and then from above again I will repeat the same thing and insert the thread opposite to that hole . I will continue doing that till I feel like it is strong then I will make knot and fix it firmly with button . my job was done .

Passage: Baking a Birthday Cake For an Awesome Nephew It was the day before my nephew 's third birthday . I wanted to bake him a very special birthday cake . He loves tractors and anything related to farms , so I wanted to include that when I decorated the cake . I decided to make a cake with three layers since he was going to be three years old . I started by finding recipes for both chocolate and yellow cake since I knew that those were his favorites .

I poured yellow cake batter in the medium - sized round baking pan since it would be the middle layer . I baked all three cakes and then cooled them . After they cooled , I stacked the cakes according to size and I frosted the bottom and top layers with yellow frosting and the middle layer with green frosting . I decorated the top of the cake with farm animals , a small toy tractor and the words , '' `` Happy Birthday Samuel . '' '' I topped off the cake with a number three candle .

Passage: After a day of washing and drying clothes , I gathered aside the items of clothing to be hung up in a separate basket . I wanted to make sure to get rid of any wrinkles in them before hanging them up . I then brought the laundry basket upstairs and brought the ironing board out of the closet . I unfolded the ironing board and got out the iron from the closet as well . I brought the iron to the sink so I could fill it in order to use the steam function . I then brought the iron to set it upon the ironing board . I plugged the iron 's cord into the socket . As I heard the iron start to heat up , I set the first item to be ironed on the board .

I already had the noodles at my house . I drove my car to my nearest supermarket . I grabbed a shopping cart and entered the store . I strolled the aisles until I found the Italian food isle . I looked around for my favorite spaghetti sauce and found it . i put it into my shopping cart and proceeded to go to the bakery section . I ordered some freshly baked Italian bread rolls . I put all the items into my shopping cart and started making my way towards the cashier check out . I placed my items on the cashier desk and paid for my items . After paying I went back to my car in the parking lot and placed the items inside my car . I drove home and started boiling the pasta and heating up the spaghetti sauce . I put the bread into the oven to heat it up . After 20 minutes the meal was ready and I sat down at the table with my family and enjoyed the meal . When I was done I washed the dishes and dinner was finished .

Passage: I saw from my alarm clock that it was time to feed my fish . I tend to feed them every day at 5:00 pm . I walked over to the tank to see how they were doing . They were swimming around and ready to be fed . I grabbed my jar of fish food and screwed the cap . Then I scooped out just enough food to feed them for one day .

I am planning to travel from Atlanta to Singapore . I note down some fares , and then I visited expedia and dunhill travel sites . . I liked the tripadvisor , after reviewing the site , and looking at the customer reviews . The number was on site . When I first talked to him , he gave me some options I think I got good deal , $ 1300 for round trip with stop at London for 14 hours and then directly to Singapore . I liked that way because I wanted to see London also . It was good timing that I could go out see London and come back , and still I was left with ease . I asked the agent , about any delaying problem , and cancellation . He told me if I add more $ 50 dollars , then I can change or cancel my trip without any penalty , and I did .

Passage: My alarm clock is not working . I think it 's the batteries . I have some extra batteries in the utility drawer . I open the drawer and find the right size . As I sit down at my desk , with the batteries , I notice the back of the alarm clock where the batteries are is crooked . I try to straighten that first but the alarm clock is still not working . I have to assume it must be the batteries . I take the old batteries out of the alarm clock and look them over for corrosion . They look fine , so maybe they are just old . I place the new batteries in the alarm clock and I make sure they make contact with the metal parts and face the right direction . Check . I slide the back of the alarm clock back on and flip the clock over . I turn the on switch on and it lights up . All I have to do now is reset the time and I 'm good to go .

Passage: I was at camp and getting ready to lead a workshop teaching cooking on a campfire . Luckily it had not rained for a few days so all the wood in the area was dry . I had some large logs that were sitting by the fire ring so I went searching for some smaller sticks and kindling . I built a log cabin structure out of the larger logs . Inside the log cabin structure I put some very small tinder as well as some balled up pieces of newspaper . I lit the newspaper and continued adding very small pieces of wood to it . When the small pieces started catching I started adding larger twigs . As smaller pieces started catching on fire I kept added larger and larger twigs and sticks until the big logs started burning . I continued to add sticks so I could get a nice sized fire burning that would create lots of hot coals so we could cook on them .

After a few minutes of this I carefully rinse the soap out of my hair . I do n't want to get it in my eyes . I then grab my bottle of conditioner and repeat what I did with the shampoo . This time though I leave it sit for a couple minutes so many hair can soak up those nutrients . I then rinse off again making sure there 's no soap what so ever left . I shut off the shower and dry off , my hair now squeaky clean .

Passage: First I go to the store and buy bread . For the freshest bread , I get a whole loaf and bring it home to slice it there . I use a bread knife which makes cutting it easier , and cut off just what I need for the toast , leaving the rest whole . I wrap and store the remaining loaf for next time . Then I get the toaster out of the cabinet and place it on the counter , then plug it in . I choose the darkness of the bread - not too dark , somewhere in the middle for flavor and safety - then indicate the slice thickness using the knob on the toaster . I place the first two slices of bread in the slots and press down on the big button , which causes the bread to drop in and the toaster to get very hot . The timer counts down and I pay attention to it carefully , making sure the toast pops up and the toaster turns off . I unplug it immediately but let it cool down before putting it away as it is very hot . I butter the bread using a knife and then put away the knives and butter .

Passage: I sometimes put a gift in a box , if it does n't already have one , to make it easier to wrap . It 's nice to put tissue paper inside the box , too . That makes opening the gift more interesting . After I have the gift boxed , I assemble my wrapping supplies . I use rolled wrapping paper , clear tape , scissors , and ribbon . Next , I unroll some wrapping paper and place the gift box on top of the flat paper . I study it , trying to figure out how much paper to cut off the roll . I do n't want to waste paper , but I also want to neatly cover the gift . Once I decide how much paper to cut off , I mark the place with pencil , then fold there , and cut the paper along the fold line . Now I turn the gift upside down , and position it in the center of my paper . I pull up one end of the paper , and tape it to the center bottom of the box . I pull the other end of the paper smooth , pull it around the box and tape it in place too . Then I do the ends of the package , folding the paper down , cutting it shorter if I must , and smoothing it neatly around the gift box . I tape it in place , and decorate the box with pretty ribbon and bows to distract from any mistakes I may have made .

Passage: Yesterday afternoon , my sister and I went to the outdoor neighborhood swimming pool . The pool requires that visitors either live in the neighborhood or be guests of a neighborhood resident in order to enter , and because we met those criteria , we had no problems getting in . The day was sunny and above eighty degrees . I wore my teal one - piece swimsuit and my sister wore her pink bikini . After we had walked to the pool from our house , we both lathered up with sunscreen and laid our towels and pool bags on vacant lounge chairs . There were only a dozen people at the pool . One of them was my sister 's friend , so she left immediately to go splash around with her and hang out on a raft . I ordered a raspberry smoothie and laid out with my copy of " Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire " while the sun heated my skin . When I started to sweat , I rinsed off in the provided shower and then put on my goggles and got into the pool to swim laps . Thankfully , the lap swim lane was clear , and I got a good work - out in . The day started to cloud over , and my sister 's friend left , so after that the two of us sat in the shallow end of the pool with the warm water rising to our shoulders and chatted until we had both had our fill of pool time . We wrapped ourselves in our towels , put our flip - flops on , and walked home from the pool .

I ordered a raspberry smoothie and laid out with my copy of " Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire " while the sun heated my skin . When I started to sweat , I rinsed off in the provided shower and then put on my goggles and got into the pool to swim laps . Thankfully , the lap swim lane was clear , and I got a good work - out in . The day started to cloud over , and my sister 's friend left , so after that the two of us sat in the shallow end of the pool with the warm water rising to our shoulders and chatted until we had both had our fill of pool time . We wrapped ourselves in our towels , put our flip - flops on , and walked home from the pool .

Passage: I like to ride on trains because you can see lots of countryside without having to worry about driving . One time , when I lived in Alaska , I rode on a train from Fairbanks to Denali park . Just like with all train rides , I had to buy a ticket first and then I had to stand in line to wait for the train to stop at the station . Then I climbed onto the train and picked a seat . The different places you can sit in a train are called cars . You do n't have assigned seats like on a plane and the seats are wide for more than one person to sit . So , I picked one in a car in the back and sat right beside the window . After the train started moving , a train attendant walked through to check our tickets and then I stood up to walk around . You can walk from car to car on a train and can even go out of the back of the very last car and stand outside , so I did that . It was very fun to be standing outside while the train was moving and I hung onto the railing to be sure I was safe . Then I went back inside and went to the dining car where I bought a sandwich and water . After I got back to my seat , I ate and watched the scenery through the window . I saw lots of interesting things including a moose and we arrived at Denali right after that .
