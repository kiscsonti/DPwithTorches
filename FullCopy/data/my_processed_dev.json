{"d_words": "I like to ride on trains because you can see lots of countryside without having to worry about driving . One time , when I lived in Alaska , I rode on a train from Fairbanks to Denali park . Just like with all train rides , I had to buy a ticket first and then I had to stand in line to wait for the train to stop at the station . Then I climbed onto the train and picked a seat . The different places you can sit in a train are called cars . You do n't have assigned seats like on a plane and the seats are wide for more than one person to sit .

I looked in the telephone book and found several pizza restaurants that would deliver . We all talked it over and settled on a pizza from Domino 's . Then we discussed what we would like on our pizza and what size we should get . I called the number and gave our order to the person who answered . We ordered a large pepperoni and onion pizza with extra cheese . He told me that our pizza would cost $ 15.00 . I said that would be fine and asked if the pizza could be delivered . He said , \" yes \" and asked for my address . I then gave him my name , address , and phone number . He told me that our pizza would be delivered in 30 minutes . When the delivery boy arrived , we paid for our pizza and included a $ 2.00 tip .

Next , I left the large store and went to nearby children 's store to pick out toys for my kids . Four games and two balls looked great and exactly what they would like . Then I spotted some outdoor clothing and searched for something to give me to a little relief from daily laundry . After I went to a wonderful new ladies purse store and bought a new Gucci for the job interview ahead , I realized it was time to meet at the food court . Realizing it was all the way across the mall , I hurriedly walked that way and saw my friends and sisters standing in front waiting .

{"d_words": "Baking a Birthday Cake For an Awesome Nephew It was the day before my nephew 's third birthday . I wanted to bake him a very special birthday cake .

I started by finding recipes for both chocolate and yellow cake since I knew that those were his favorites . I made the batter for the chocolate cake in one bowl and then the batter for the yellow cake in another bowl . I poured some chocolate cake batter in the largest and the smallest round baking pans since the top and bottom layers would be chocolate . I poured yellow cake batter in the medium - sized round baking pan since it would be the middle layer . I baked all three cakes and then cooled them . After they cooled , I stacked the cakes according to size and I frosted the bottom and top layers with yellow frosting and the middle layer with green frosting . I decorated the top of the cake with farm animals , a small toy tractor and the words , '' `` Happy Birthday Samuel . '' '' I topped off the cake with a number three candle .

I found a recipe online for an easy to make cake , printed out a list of the ingredients , and went to the grocery store to get them . I knew about some of the common things , like eggs , flour , and sugar , but the list helped me get a lot of things I did n't own and would n't know to get . When I got home , I followed the recipe as closely as I could , adding each of the ingredients at the exact amount of the recipe asked for . I mixed them all up as described , and put them into a pan that I had borrowed from my mother . I put the pan in the oven and let the cake cook . I checked on it occasionally to see if it was looking OK , and because I was really excited to see how it was turning out . When it was done in the oven I removed it , and applied an extra thick coat of frosting . I was supposed to wait for the cake to cook , but I was too excited to try it out and ate it much sooner than recommended .

{"d_words": "Yesterday evening , my friend Jasmine called me on my cell phone . We talked about so many things and we were on the phone for about two hours . She asked me how life was ever since I moved from Denver to Atlanta . I told her that life had been amazing and the only thing that sucks , is the horrible traffic . Jasmine also mentioned that she will be visiting me next month for a week long vacation . I was so excited to hear that I will have a visitor because sometimes it can get lonely not having family in the same city as you . I told Jasmine that I will plan to take her to some of the best restaurants in town and plan a big shopping trip . During our phone call , we also talked about the days when we were in college together . After a while of talking , we decided that it was time to get off the phone and take care of some things at home .

{"d_words": "I went out to eat at a restaurant last weekend with my husband . We went to a place that is pretty popular in town and has gotten really good reviews . We had to wait a few minutes for a table , but soon enough we were seated . The restaurant had a warm and friendly feel , and our waiter appeared right after we were seated . She was warm and friendly too . She greeted us and asked for our drink orders . My husband just wanted water , but I got an unsweet tea with lemon . We chose not to order an appetizer , but the waitress brought our drinks and a basket of rolls for us to snack on . We ordered our entrees then , having had time to study the menu . My husband got a steak and baked potato with a side of steamed broccoli and I ordered the salmon and wild rice . Our waitress took the order , then promised to have our food out soon . We sampled the bread while she was gone . The rolls were delicious and the tea was refreshing . My husband and I began talking about how our days had been and discussing moving , which we are in the middle of currently . We talked for a few minutes until our food arrived , then settled down to eat . I had only taken a bite of my fish , however , when I realized that something was wrong . The smell was off and it had a bad taste . I thought it must be bad . I waited until our waitress was coming back by , then I asked her if she would take it back and bring me something different , because I felt like the salmon was going bad . She agreed and I ordered a steak like my husband got . He said his was delicious . The waitress took the fish and apologized profusely . She brought my steak out very shortly and it was fantastic . She kept checking on us throughout the meal , and the manager even came over to offer us a free dessert . He apologized for the salmon and said that the cook had made a mistake and pulled from the stock that was about to be thrown away . We accepted the free dessert , New York - style cheesecake . It was so creamy and sweet . We enjoyed our meal , overall . Our waitress brought us out ticket and even marked down our meal .
